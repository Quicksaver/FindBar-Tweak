A Firefox add-on to improve the Find in page bar, with many appearance and functionality improvements. For more information go to https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/findbar-tweak/.

If you wish to localize the add-on to your language, you can do so via Babelzilla: http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&Itemid=0&type=show&extension=5562 and I will include it in the next update as soon as I can. Don't forget to change the localization status to "Released" when you're finished, so the system notifies me of this by e-mail. Please, don't submit a localization directly in Github. While I do greatly appreciate the intent, the git repository doesn't include the AMO description strings, and it's much harder for you, and for myself, to keep track of updates to localizations in here.
